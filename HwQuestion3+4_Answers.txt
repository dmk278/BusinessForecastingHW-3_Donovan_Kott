Data Collection Methodology: The Unemployment in America, Per US State data is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is updated every month.
Why does this data set intrigue me?: I am very interested in American History and the economy. The unemployment rate of each state each month over time is interesting to me because you can compare this data to other economic and political data trends in histort. I am also intrguied because the employment rates directly afftect me after graduation.
